Approach #1
- "pages" folder will hold the components that are in the end rendered as full screen pages
- "components" folder will hold components that are not used as full screen components but instead
are used only in parts of the screen ( buttons, the new product page etc form )

Approach #2
- Split logic by feature, creating "pages" and "components" subfolders for "places" folder and 
for the "user" folder.
